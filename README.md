# Guess-the-Color-and-Hex-Color-Generator

Sure, here's an updated README file that includes instructions for both parts of your code:

Guess the Color and Hex Color Generator

This is a web application that includes two parts. The first part is a guessing game where the user tries to guess a color from a pre-defined list of colors. The second part generates a random hexadecimal color code and sets the background color of the webpage to the generated color.

Part 1: Guess the Color

To play the guessing game, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine or download the code as a zip file and extract it to a folder on your computer.
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
Type your guess into the input field and click on the "Guess" button.
If your guess is correct, the background color of the webpage will change to the guessed color and you will see a success message. If your guess is incorrect, you will see a failure message.
You can play the game multiple times by clicking on the "New Color" button to generate a new random color from the pre-defined list.
Part 2: Hex Color Generator

To generate a random hexadecimal color code, follow these steps:

Open the index.html file in a web browser.
Click on the "Generate Color" button to generate a new random color.
The background color of the webpage will be updated to the generated color and the hexadecimal color code will be displayed on the screen.
Technologies Used

The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
